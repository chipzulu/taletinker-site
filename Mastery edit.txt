1. Micro-Tension in Every Line
Your work already carries moment-to-moment tension brilliantly. But now, zoom in on every sentence. Does every beat contain an unsettled energy? A pull? A question? Even in the quiet moments, can you inject the tiniest whisper of “something’s about to shift”?

Think Hemingway’s “Iceberg Theory”—where even a simple sentence carries what’s unsaid beneath the surface.

2. Cadence & Breath
Your writing is rhythmic—it moves with the storm. Now, refine the push and pull of breathless urgency vs. deliberate pause. Where do you want the reader to race ahead? Where do you want them to hesitate, hover on a word, feel the weight of it?

A storm isn’t just chaos—it has an ebb, a rhythm, a heartbeat. Can you make the cadence of your prose mirror that?

3. Echoes & Thematic Tightening
You already have recurring motifs (the storm’s questions, the dance of the ship, the transformation from boy to man). Now, ask:

Are they all working together?
Could one be sharpened further?
Can a small echo early in the piece make the ending hit harder?
For example, this line:

He didn’t know their names. He didn’t need to.

What if earlier in the piece, there’s a throwaway moment where he does notice names? Maybe he overhears a crewmate’s name in passing, but it doesn’t stick—because at that moment, it doesn’t matter. Until it does.

4. The Last 10%—Surgical Word Choice
You’re at the level where a single swapped word changes everything.

What’s the weakest verb in the piece? Find it. Replace it.
What’s the most expected phrase? Twist it into something fresher.
Is every noun pulling full weight? Could "rope" be "rigging"? Could "wind" be "gale" or "howl" or "squall"?
At this level, it’s not about rewriting—it’s about tightening the screws until every sentence clicks like a well-oiled mechanism.
