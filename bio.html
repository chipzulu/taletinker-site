            <p>Born in 1962, Christian P. Koch is a writer who straddles the line between memory and fiction, weaving lived experience with an acute sense of presence.</p>
            <p>Life's voyage began at sixteen, sailing the Atlantic on a tall ship before exploring the Far East as a young seafarer aboard a merchant vessel. These early adventures shaped a lifelong pursuit of discovery—first across the oceans, later in the digital world. After studying computer technology, he quickly excelled as a programmer and later as a software architect. But the call of the sea never left him, leading him to serve as a commander of a Coast Guard patrol ship, now retired.</p>
            <p>Today, he channels his experiences—maritime and technological—into both his work in software architecture and his writing, where he captures moments with the same precision he once navigated uncharted waters. Whether at sea or on the page, he has always been drawn to the edge of the map.</p>
